Hello and welcome! My name is Joshua Lucker. I am currently a 4th year PhD student in Biophysics at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). I graduated in 2018 from UMCP's sister campus, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) with dual degrees in Chemistry (B.S.) and Mathematics (B.A., essentially a degree in Applied Mathematics). As you can tell, I am a proud Maryland native.\n\n

Currently, I am working in the lab of Prof. Jeffery Klauda in the Chemical Engineering department at UMCP, although my expertise spans many disciplines (e.g. computational biophysics, biophysical chemistry, molecular & thermodynamic modeling). My current projects include the implementation and development of a united-atom force field for lipids (especially sphingolipids) in the CHARMM force field, and the investigation of the effects of beryllium on plasma membrane lipids and the development of a beryllium force field.\n\n
